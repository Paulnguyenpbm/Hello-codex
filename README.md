# Staircase Configurator

This repository contains a simple website that allows you to configure a staircase.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser. The page loads the Three.js library from a
CDN, so an internet connection is required. Adjust the parameters for the number
of steps, step dimensions, and staircase width. The preview displays a simple 3D
staircase that updates automatically based on your selections.
