# Staircase Configurator

This repository contains a simple website that allows you to configure a staircase.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Adjust the parameters for the number of steps,
step dimensions, and staircase width. The preview updates automatically to show the
staircase based on your selections. The preview now renders the staircase with a 3D
effect using CSS transforms, so a browser with support for CSS3 3D transformations
(recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) is required.
