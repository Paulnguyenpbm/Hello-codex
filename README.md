# Staircase Configurator

This repository contains a simple website that allows you to configure a staircase.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser. Adjust the parameters for the number of steps,
step dimensions, and staircase width. The preview updates automatically to show the
staircase based on your selections.

## Deploying Online

You can host this project using GitHub Pages or any other static hosting service.
Push the repository to GitHub and enable **GitHub Pages** in the repository
settings. Once enabled, the contents of the selected branch will be served as a
website after a short delay.

When deploying elsewhere, upload `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` so
that they are served from the same directory. The page relies on the Three.js
CDN, so an active internet connection is required when the site loads.
